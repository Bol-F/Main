                            Explanation
Inheritance is a key concept in object-oriented programming (OOP).
It allows one class (called the child class or subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (called the parent class or superclass).
This promotes code reuse, enables a hierarchical structure, and simplifies code maintenance.


                            Key Concepts
Parent Class (Superclass): The base class that provides attributes and methods to its subclasses.
Child Class (Subclass): A class that inherits from a parent class and can have additional attributes or methods.
super(): A function that allows access to the parent classâ€™s methods or attributes,
often used to call the parent class constructor (__init__()).
